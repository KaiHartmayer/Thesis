# Semantic Analysis of Lithium-Ion Battery Patents Using Text Mining and Machine Learning

Welcome to the repository of my thesis project.


### Quick-Guide for the Repository:
df_lemma_dropped.ipynb: data preprocessing; saves the working dataframe for the main part of the thesis as a CSV file.
descriptives.ipynb: code to obtain the descriptive statistics reported in the results section of the thesis.
time_period_analysis_(plots).ipynb: includes several plots of structured data over time. Only the first plot is shown in the paper.
demonstration_simplified.ipynb: code to reproduce the simplified example of the figure in the method section.

Due to RAM limitations, the main code has been split up into several Jupyter Notebooks:
get_tfidf_dummy: makes word pair variables and applies the specified filters, saving results to a CSV file.
